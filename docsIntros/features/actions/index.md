# Actions

Actions define operations that can be triggered by the user.

There are two kinds:
- General actions (list-level)
- Row actions (row-specific)

Actions may:
- execute immediately
- require selection
- open modal flows

Actions do not render UI by themselves.
They are triggered from Toolbar or Table slots.
