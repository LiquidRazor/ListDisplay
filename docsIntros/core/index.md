# Core

This section documents the core implementation details and internal architecture.

The core folder contains the foundational building blocks:

- it defines the feature system and execution pipeline
- it provides state management primitives
- it implements the context and slot infrastructure

Most consumers won't need to interact with these internals directly, as they are abstracted by the component layer.

See:

- Feature definitions
- State management
- Context providers
